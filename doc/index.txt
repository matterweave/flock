### Editing for absolute power

So, you've got a game idea. It's been reworked a thousand times, and it's ready
to be implemented. Wouldn't an editor that's extremely easy to use be a
god-send?

The editor should be the entry point into any project. Each portion of the
editor will be described in detail (from the standpoint of the user). Whenever
a special component is introduced, it will be stated with some **Emphasis** to
make future referencing easier.

### Everything is a simulation

Games are a reflection of the real world. Everything is just a moving piece.
Each piece has it's own behavior, and when they interact, crazy things happen.

The game engine works off this principle. Say the main character has a rocket
launcher. Each rocket works the same. So why not take advantage of this
reusability? After making a rocket and giving it behavior, new rockets can
be quickly be created on the fly.
